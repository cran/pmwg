Description: Provides an R implementation of the Particle Metropolis within
    Gibbs sampler for model parameter, covariance matrix and random effect
    estimation. A more general implementation of the sampler based on the paper
    by Gunawan, D., Hawkins, G. E., Tran, M. N., Kohn, R., & Brown, S. D.
    (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2020.102368>. An HTML tutorial document describing
    the package is available at <https://newcastlecl.github.io/samplerDoc/> and
    includes several detailed examples, some background and troubleshooting
    steps.
